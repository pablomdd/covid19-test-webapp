This is a COVID-19 test powered by Machine Learning to give a reliable diagnosis.

## About
This was the final project for the Neurofuzzy Systems Class (2020-2) at IPN UPIITA.

This repository is a web app built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) that relies upon [TensorFlowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for evaluating the results. 

The machine learning algorithm was originally developed in MATLAB and can be found in [this other repository](https://github.com/pablomdd/covid_test_ml). There you will find the methodology and further medical references.

## Disclaimer
We do not intend replacing a doctor nor a physical test, we are giving to the users a suggestion to go to a hospital or to stay in home, based on their symptoms.

## Contribute
**PR's are welcome**. Our time and resources were limited at the time of developing so we specially thank contribution in both the Web App Test and the [Machine Learning model repository](https://github.com/pablomdd/covid_test_ml) (speacilly on the training for better and more accurate results).
